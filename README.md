<h2> How It's Made </h2>

Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, Photoshop.

I built this website using react.js library. It is my first completed projected using this library. I designed the current landing page illustration using Adobe Photoshop.

 I learned a lesson in breaking down problems and taking more time to dive into documentation before trying to implementing things.
